            Remember the time when your eyes were shining with the thought of the
            future? When the future became synonymous with freedom. Childhood was the
            time when we realised dreaming needs no money or any degree but enthusiasm
            and a mind that can run wild. We were ready to be everything from the
            police to doctors, from stepping into business to owning a whole city.
            None of these sent butterflies or any knots inside the stomach. None of
            these made us nervous or doubt ourselves. We were ready to become whoever
            we want to be, whatsoever the world could offer. While growing up, even
            the stage starts to frighten, bosses and managers become vampires and
            interviewers turn into monsters who can reject you for any reason.
            Everything became different and while adapting to this difference we
            forgot what we really wanted to be. Now the person standing in front of
            us, in the mirror, is totally different with a different job than
            expected, with a different persona. Perhaps everything is better but
            mostly that change doesn't excite us just like dreaming used to in our
            childhood. Even while looking in the mirror there was a discombobulated
            look on the face and a mind with thousands of “what if’s”. Do we really
            want to be like this? To fear something that's behind a door rather than
            prepare for it. To doubt ourselves even when a whole lot of people believe
            in us. We forgot how to believe in ourselves. The future is uncertain. The
            people who will stand with us are uncertain. The job that we’re going to
            have is uncertain. And how this uncertainty will treat us is a question
            itself and the root of all these doubts. Even while preparing for any
            competitive exam or a simple presentation in front of the class we could
            feel butterflies in our stomachs or worse dancing feet. But what are we
            afraid of? It's either the outcome or the opinion. The outcome is going to
            impact our future and the impact can be terribly atrocious or highly
            satisfactory. We can think about the good part but our brain focuses on
            the atrocious one. It starts with what if ‘I will fail’ and this fear of
            failure or rejection leads to gloomy feelings and makes us feel worthless.
            Every time you try to escape it will turn stronger and will make you a
            part of it without you knowing. Anticipatory anxiety describes the fear
            and worries about bad things that could happen. It can happen in a lot of
            different contexts, but it commonly focuses on things we can't predict or
            control. Most people couldn't start because they are afraid of losing. The
            constant fear of losing causes several good ideas to go in vain. A man,
            let's call him Arjun, was working under one of his relatives. Where his
            relative was a wholesaler and Arjun was just an ordinary retailer. he
            learnt everything under his relative's guidance but stayed a retailer out
            of respect. Arjun was hardworking and wanted to live a better life with
            his family. So he did two jobs, earning enough to feed his wife and two
            children. Arjuns relatives have to move to some other part of the country
            and change their business too. After his relative everything was supposed
            to transfer to Arjun, as he was their only relative. But that didn't
            happen. His relative gave it to some random person. Now Arjun wanted to
            start his own shop but he was afraid. The fear of the outcome, whether it
            will work out or not. Like many of us, Arjun was afraid to start his own
            business, not that he was not capable or experienced. But because he was
            just not confident enough. So how should we stop these fears from taking
            us over? In the movie ‘Three Idiots', Aamir Khan taught us how to fool our
            brains. Try using mantras like him. Just like he used to say “ all is
            well”, try something for yourself. If your mind is constantly putting you
            in a loop of doubts then fool it. “Everything is safe, I'll do great. I've
            worked hard.” repeat these till you realise you're fine. Journaling is
            very helpful. The feeling of us being alone is removed while writing it
            down. Most of the time we need to put things down on a piece of paper and
            everything seems so simple. If you want to help yourself in the long run
            then nothing is better than mindfulness. Mindfulness not only calms you
            down but helps you in introspection. It also helps in staying calm and
            composed in difficult situations In the case of Arjun, his wife helped him
            fool his mind. She said, she’ll help him out in every situation and
            motivated him to move forward. From living in a small room to building his
            own houses, from walking in old weary slippers to owning cars he did a
            great job. And everything started after conquering the fear. So, it's okay
            if the future scares you and you find it hard to dream. In this realistic
            world, your dreams might look unrealistic to many. But it's always worth a
            try then regretting it your whole life. I remember reading a quote,
            “things are never as bleak as they seem in the midst of anxiety ”
