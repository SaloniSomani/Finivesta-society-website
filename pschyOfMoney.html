                    The Psychology of Money is one of the best books that teach important lessons in financial management. Housel explains how finance is taught in terms of basic formulas. Based on this, we take decisions and actions to manage your finances. "Money's greatest intrinsic value, not to be overemphasized, is its ability to control time." But in real life, people make financial decisions based on their emotions and intuition. People don't make decisions on spreadsheets. People make decisions sitting at the dining table over dinner in a conference room where egos, pride, and ideas about the world all mix.

                    The book offers a better perspective on how to really perceive money and its value. The book begins with a simple anecdote. Making money and managing money are two different premises. You can become an expert in your field and earn a large and decent salary, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be good at staying wealthy in the long run. You need to manage your own finances and the expenses that determine your net worth. People often use the money to show their status and pride in society. However, people can easily fall into debt traps and loans, often leaving little savings for emergencies and independent living.

                    Housel also dives into the consequences of our decisions. He looks at how debt, investments, and other financial moves can have serious implications in the long term, and how our choices often don’t align with our long-term goals. He looks at how our financial decisions can have wide-reaching consequences, including on our relationships, our careers, and even our own mental health. The Psychology of Money is an enjoyable read that provides a deep understanding of the psychology behind money and financial decisions. It’s full of interesting anecdotes and data-driven insights that help readers better understand the psychology of money and their own financial decision-making.

He provides a compelling and thought-provoking look at the subject, and his insights are sure to leave readers with plenty to think about. The book is a must-read for anyone looking to improve their financial decision-making and gain a deeper understanding of the psychology of money.
