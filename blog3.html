            <p> Being able to predict where the markets are headed is the holy grail of finance and it is only to be expected
                that data science plays an increasingly important role in FinTech.
                Let’s delve deeper into this subset of AI which helps govern the backbone of the world’s economy,i.e., the
                finance sector.
                Data science is the field of study that deals with a huge volume of data using modern technologically driven
                tools and techniques to find some sort of pattern and derive meaningful information out of it that eventually
                helps in business and financial decisions.</p>
                
                <p class="p2">Data Science Applications in Finance Industry include -</p>
                
            <ol>
                <li>Risk Analytics:</li> 
                <p class="p2">Every company faces every sort of risk while doing business. Analyzing the threats and risks has become a
                crucial part of every organization. This is a strategic step that is known as risk analytics. A company can
                increase it’s effectiveness and security by applying data science in financial markets since data is the core of
                risk management. Data science has in it the knowledge of problem-solving making strategies.</p>
               
                <li>   Real-time Analytics:</li> 
               <p class="p2"> With dynamic data pipelines and advancements in technology, it has become easier to analyze data in real time
                and organizations can get data based on the current circumstances. Finance in data science keeps a track of the
                financial and investment attributes of a company.</p>
                <li>Consumer Analytics:</li> 
                <p class="p2">Consumer personalization is an integral part of many organizations. The application of data analytics in finance
                helps to acquire insights into consumer behavior in real-time to make better strategic business decisions.</p>
                <li>Personalized Services:</li> 
                <p class="p2"> If a company is aiming to maintain good relations with it’s customers to increase the sales, then personalized
                services are a great technique. The needs of the customers are understood and actionable insights are gained
                which is beneficial for the organization. Those insights are also used to provide better and optimized services
                to customers.</p>
                  
                <li>Financial Fraud Detection:</li> 
                <p class="p2">The increasing number of transactions also increases the chances of fraud. However, with the help of big data
                    and its analytical tools, Financial institutions can keep track of scams and frauds in a better way. Also, if
                    there is any unusual pattern in trading that has been identified with the help of various machine learning
                    tools, investigations are instantly done by the alerted Financial institutions in this regard.
                          </p>
                <li> Algorithmic Trading:</li>
                <p class="p2">Algorithmic trading is used to channel huge data into streamlined information. This allows financial
                institutions to make effective predictions of financial markets.</p> 
            </ol>
            
            <p class = "p2">The benefits of Using Data Science for Finance include :</p>
            
        
            <ol>
                <li>Improved Sales and Revenue:</li>
                <p class="p2"> Many financial companies feel the need to increase their customer interaction with high-quality personal
                    connections. Data science allows companies to see whether their customers are experiencing improved
                    facilities or not.</p>
                <li> Getting Helpful Insights:</li>
        
                <p class="p2">Fraud and cyber crimes have become more prevalent with the growing number of transactions in the country.
                    Nowadays, the damages are prevented by sporting irregularities on data-driven financial platforms.
                    Fraud research has generated data-driven conclusions such as those trustworthy clients with a verified
                    purchasing history that can benefit the company and also minimize the risk of fraud.
                    On the other hand, financial transactions and parameters are monitored in real-time when riskier clients are
                    involved. </p>
                <li>Optimized Routine via Robotic Process Automation:</li>
                <p class="p2">The routine and reconciliation processes of the companies are very time-consuming. Data scientists in finance
                    can save time and resources by matching transactions across multiple data sources. Robotic process
                    automation reduces risk assessment and creditworthiness by presenting conclusions about consumer data in a
                    clear manner.
        
                    Hence, in finance, data science helps a financial organization to provide avenues where profit can be
                    maximized, risks can be minimized and new investments can be made securely. Since the finance industry is so
                    dynamic, data science has evolved to be a highly flexible and adaptive form of discipline & managing
                    finances by understanding the same has become more a necessity than a trend.</p>
