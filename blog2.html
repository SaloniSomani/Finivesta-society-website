        ‘The story of Fin-Tech seems to have only really begun’
        This simple statement is enough to explain the entire globe’s scenario currently. Researchers all over the world are keeping their best foot forward to change the way people are handling their finances ranging from giant business owners to everyday users. Fin-Tech comprises two words ‘Finance’ and ‘Technology’. These two areas have been together for years and are evolving continuously.
         Emerging technologies are finding their way to make financial lives easy and reduce the ample amount of work and time that people spend at the click of a button. Both the professional and commercial industries have been changing workflows and business processes. The future financial technology and economic sector are no exception anymore. This industry is expanding with every second that passes, and we all are awaiting a breakthrough in this field that will alter the way we think about the finance industry completely. It is flooded with mind-boggling advancements like NLP (Natural Language Processing), Robotic Process Automation, and Voice Bots along with AI and ML (Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning). 
        Amongst these many technologies, we have blockchain.
        Blockchain was discovered by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and it has been expanding since then. It is a decentralized, distributed ledger that stores the record of ownership of digital assets. Basically, off-the-books transactions are extremely popular. There existed some or other databases where the information of these transactions was stored but the problem lay in the fact that this information was neither easily accessible nor reliable. Anybody with access could alter it easily. The introduction of blockchain ended this possibility and made this system completely reliable and secure. Any data stored on the blockchain is unmodifiable, making the technology a legitimate disruptor for industries like payments, cybersecurity, and healthcare. Hence, not just financial transactions, it can be programmed to record virtually everything of value. 
        Simply put, it’s a digital ledger. But unlike a bank/financial institution/governing body’s ledger, it is not centrally controlled but is distributed across a network.
        As the name suggests, ‘blockchain’ is a series of blocks coming together in the form of a chain. Every single block holds valuable information. The first kind of information is the relevant information which is dependent on the use case of that blockchain. It will record the type of data we want to store in that block. Next comes ‘Hash’. It is a unique address that helps us in distinguishing one block from the other and hence provides every block with a distinct identity. The next information that it stores is called ‘Previous Hash’. It is basically the unique identity of the previous block. As all the blocks will store their respective addresses and the ones behind them, they are forming a chain-like pattern, hence justifying the name. Changes made in a single block would change its hash and hence we need to make alterations in all the subsequent blocks which is a tedious job. To ensure that change has been made, a concept called ‘proof of work’ is taken into consideration. Also, a copy of a single blockchain is shared amongst all the people in the network, and therefore changes made by one need to be accepted by others via a voting system which is called the ‘consensus rule’. Thus, these layers of security make it an extremely reliable technology to store heavy and crucial data.
        This technology has found its immense usage and the most common being cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a type of digital currency in which a record of transactions is maintained, and new units of currency are generated by the computational solution of mathematical problems, and which operates independently of a central bank. Therefore, it has eliminated banks as a medium and allows the transfer of money in the form of Bitcoin anywhere across the globe with minimal charges replacing the traditional methods of changing currencies and high fees. In the case of real estate, it has shown some outstanding improvements. It is used to replace the notary and helps in recording buying and selling of different properties which also subsequently gives a concrete history of any real estate property. Hospital management systems have also started using this technology to record the data of patients. This facilitates doctors to get relevant information and hence provide proper medication and treatment. There are countless other ways in which people can use this technology and create wonders.
        To use blockchain technology, one can either start by creating it from scratch or use existing blockchains as well. ‘Social contracts’ are digital contracts that help in explaining how the exchange of information is going to take place. To take advantage of any existing blockchains, we need to use them. ‘Ethereum’ is a blockchain that is extensively used nowadays and to use this one must learn Solidity, which is a programming language. So, by using Solidity and understanding social contacts one can use Ethereum for their own applications. 
        
        The potential of this technology has not completely been harnessed and ground-breaking developments could emerge in the next few years. In conclusion, this technology is spreading like wildfire. There are numerous challenges that people are facing right now, and it will take time. But, once figured out, it will replace the current technologies in the financial sector for good
