                    This is the unfettered story of Ashneer Grover-the favorite and misunderstood poster boy of Start-up India.
                    A Raw, gut-wrenching in its honesty, and completely from the heart, this is storytelling at its finest.
                    <br><br>
                    A young boy with a 'refugee' tag growing up in Delhi's Malviya Nagar outpaces his circumstances by becoming a rank-holder at the pinnacle of academic excellence in India-IIT Delhi. He goes on to do an MBA from the hallowed halls of IIM Ahmedabad, builds a career as an investment banker at Kotak Investment Banking and AmEx, and is pivotal in the making of two unicorns-Grofers, as CFO, and BharatPe, as co-founder. As a judge on the popular TV show Shark Tank India, Ashneer becomes a household name even as his life turns upside down. Controversy, media spotlight, and garrulous social media chatter descend, making it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. The book starts with the scene from Bharatpe Saga in January 2022 and then quickly moves on to Ashneer's childhood. Ashneer has described his childhood, his trips as a middle-class refugee boy, his background, and the profession of his parents quite vividly. He describes how he with his wife, moved into a 1BHK in Mumbai at a reasonable salary after getting his first job with Kotak. At Kotak, he explains the investment deals he cracked as a member of the Kotak IB Team and how that shaped his investment-raising abilities which later came to his aid during his BharatPe Stint. He then goes on to describe his career at Amex, Grofers, and PC Jewellers.

                    He not only talked about his highs but also his lows i.e, he not only covered his mistakes but also gave life advice from his experience to help the reader learn from them. Throughout the book, there are several life and business lessons ranging from “put yourself first, always” to “it is important to remember that the investor is just another vendor”.Attribute it to Ashneer's writing ability or his life journey, the book is very interesting and will compel you to complete it in one sitting.
