                    Rich Dad Poor Dad written by  Robert T. Kiyosaki is a New York Times Best Seller first published in 1997. It has been one of the most popular business books since then. The title of the book is luring as it helps the reader to develop an interest in it.
                    <br><br>
                    The book is a compilation of the author's childhood stories. Here the author draws a comparison between his two dad’s financial advice. One represents his ‘rich’ father, while the other represents his ‘poor’ father. His first dad was a learned scholar and worked with an university as a professor, he had fixed pay, job security, and education yet he led all his life as a poor man while his other dad wasn’t much educated and didn’t have a job but he managed his business well and went to become one of the richest men in Hawaii. His real dad believes in education as it helps in uplifting the roots of life and prioritizes education over money. Poor dad says that money is of no real value. He argues to the point that success doesn’t depend on money but depends on knowledge.

                    Although he respected both men, at the age of nine, he decided to listen to his “rich dad” about how to make money.

                    The book talks about financial literacy and what are the key points to becoming rich. It smoothly explains assets and liabilities. Whatever the middle-class people treat as assets, actually they are liabilities.
                    <br><br>
                    The key pointers which are highlighted in this book are as follows-
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>One of the most important keys to becoming rich is financial literacy, in other words, learning how to handle money.</li>
                        <li>An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while poor and middle class tend to buy the luxuries first.”</li>
                        <li>It’s often not how much money you make. It’s how much money you can keep.</li>
                        <li>The poor and the middle-class work for money. Wealthy people have money that works for them.</li>
                        <li>Find something above and beyond your current reality, your wildest fantasy.</li>
                    </ol>
                    This book teaches about money, mindset, challenges, tactics, and balancing life. It provides a contrarian view that is different from the common view. But this book does not describe the practical ways of becoming rich as it is mostly for written motivation not by the financial expert. But it's very useful for beginners who want to explore the world of finance as it teaches financial literacy.
