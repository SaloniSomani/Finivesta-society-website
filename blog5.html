            The term ‘robot’ conjures up visions of a human look-alike, performing all
            manner of tasks. However, in the world of information technology, it
            refers to a software program, chatbot, and the list goes on. Various
            industrial sectors use robots to automate their activities and processes
            as it enhances operational productivity and reduces overall costs. Now
            let's discuss the compatibility of robotic processes in one arena which is
            fintech. Today, various institutions and companies are offering financial
            services. To make their work quicker and easier, they take recourse to
            mobile devices, cloud services, the Internet or software technology. Such
            establishments are tagged as ‘Fintechs’. Given the competitiveness of
            today’s financial firms, the idea is to enhance the customer experience in
            handling investments, insurance, and payments, through different
            applications. In turn, customers bond much better with the financial
            aspects of their lives. The use of robotic process automation (RPA) has
            many advantages over the traditional workflow in the fintech industry.
            However, there are challenges in the implementation of truly integrated
            systems that could bring business to the next level. RPA is the use of
            software to automate repetitive and rule-based tasks using
            cross-application programs, also called robots. It is used for more than
            cost savings, as there are several types of tasks in which robots
            outperform humans — properly programmed robots don’t get tired or make
            mistakes. That is why robots are particularly useful in highly diligent
            and time-critical tasks.RPA not only allows faster processing of
            repetitive operations but also ensures consistency and quality. All robots
            are the same and their output is rules-driven, thus identical, while
            people are different,” Galdikas said. “When a process resolution needs to
            be described and logged in writing, robots will always deliver the same
            quality of texts, no grammar mistakes or personal bias of a human. This
            diligence is incredibly useful in the context of financial operations,
            where accuracy and speed are key. RPA not only allows faster processing of

            FINTECH:- People are increasingly turning ‘digital’ in their mindsets and
            actions. They want to invest money, make payments, transfer funds or
            obtain loans, as quickly as possible via hassle-free ways. Fintech firms
            prove highly useful here, guiding traditional financial establishments in
            the usage of robotic process automation.

              RPA is a tremendous boon for this arena! Banks and other financial
              companies may set up 24 x 7 chatbots to interact with customers, who can
              seek comfort in the fact that someone is there to answer queries or deal
              with their concerns at any hour of the day or night. As a result, they
              remain loyal to their respective banks/companies. Customers also love
              the fact that RPA software reduces the time spent processing.
              Additionally, fewer errors crop up in the processes. Thus, financial
              interactions are comparatively faster and more accurate.

              Human beings cannot match the speed of RPA. For instance, RPA platforms
              undertake tasks, such as garnering accurate data and communicating with
              legacy systems and completing them at a much faster pace. RPA helps in
              identifying and removing ‘pain’ points, and businesses can always look
              for upgrading themselves from legacy to new-gen tech. Talking about
              another aspect – employees waste plenty of time on repetitive tasks.
              This does not allow them to put their skills to effective use. It also
              proves a hindrance to professional and personal growth. A good example
              that can be quoted in this scenario is the handling of basic insurance
              claims. If RPA takes it over, underwriters can spend their valuable time
              tackling complicated claims. RPA cannot make mistakes or circumvent
              traditional processes. It follows, therefore, that there are no delays
              and verifications become easier. Thus, consumers remain happy.
