                Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings among other projects. Every project comes with a cost and this is where financial knowledge comes into the picture.
                
                Building things requires money. First, to buy the raw materials needed, then to pay the workers, and then to pay for the machinery that will be used to make the things. Then further, the operation will be done in a building that will cost money and there will be utility bills and taxes on it. Then the materials needed, are to be transported to the place where they will be used. This involves equipment, which costs money and taxes. Also, for an engineer to produce results, estimating the costs, and predicting the savings and return on investment are critical. These monetary elements will generally be essential to gain support and approval to actually do the work. The cost, effort, and financial consequences is an important stepping stones in their careers.
                
                Money skills, people skills, communication ability, negotiation, and selling skills are all critical to the effectiveness of engineers. The technical, analytical, and scientific abilities of an engineer are only useful when the other skills make it possible to get projects approved and team members engaged. It may be possible to work in a narrow, technical niche as an engineer, but if you do, your career opportunities are poor and your value to your employer hardly justifies the time and money to become an engineer.
                Some of the basic financing tips are as follows:
                Live below your means- Deprive yourself of money early in life, so you can invest your way to wealth later.
                Build a machine- You can’t get rich by doing a job or business alone, you need to create systems of passive income where you invest an amount and get ten times it back.
                Good debt vs bad debt- Bad debt is that lose your money like a credit card or high-interest loans and good debts are the ones that make you more money than the interest you pay.
                Save 10% of your salary every month- People who don’t have money saved are one step away from a disaster spiral as they may lose their job or get an accidental medical bill and resort to high-interest loans.
                Invest money in yourself- Spend money on developing your skills and for self-improvement because your wealth cannot grow without you.
                Planned purchases- Do not do impulsive purchases, they may contribute to the increased dopamine levels for a while but you might later realise that you didn’t need it that much. Hence, a waste of money.
                These tips are not only for engineers but also for people who want to generate wealth, in a good positive way.
                Thus concluding, being financially literate is a skill that brings forth an assortment of benefits that can improve the standard of living for not only engineers but all individuals through an increase in financial stability. Financial knowledge provides individuals with the ability to make financial decisions, effectively management of money and debt, be better equipped to reach financial goals, reduction of expenses through better regulation, less financial stress and anxiety and effectively creation of a structured budget, among other things. Making steps to becoming financially literate is an important component of life that can ensure financial solidity, reduce
